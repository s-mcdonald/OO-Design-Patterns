# Design Patterns (PHP)

Here are some design patterns I created for a recent Developer test I had recently completed to show some basic patterns and principles.

## Files 
There are 2 main folder, 
`public` and `Thrive`


The `Public` Folder contains the entry point, or the public index.php file for the program.

```php
public/pattern_decorator.php = the Decorator Pattern
public/pattern_singleton.php = the Singleton Pattern
public/pattern_factory.php = the Factory Pattern
```



The `Thrive` folder contains the Class files for all the examples.
The actual implementation of the Patterns can be found in this folder.

```php
Decorator Pattern   = Thrive\DecoratorPattern
Singleton Pattern   = Thrive\SingletonPattern
Factory Pattern     = Thrive\FactoryPattern
```
